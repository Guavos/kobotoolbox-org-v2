      <p>There are two publicly available instances of KoBoToolbox, one for the general public and a separate one for the humanitarian community, hosted directly by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. For more information on the differences between the two servers, please read our <a href="{{which_server_url}}" target="_blank">Which Server Should I Use?</a> support article.</p>

      <p>Note that it is also possible to install KoBoToolbox on your own server (or on a local machine) using Docker. See our <a href="{{kobo_install_url}}" target="_blank">kobo-install repository on GitHub</a> for details.</p>
