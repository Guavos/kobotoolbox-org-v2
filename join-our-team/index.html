        <p>At this time, we are looking for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A full-time, back-end developer</strong>. We are happy
                to consider developers with diverse professional experience,
                provided they are committed to mastering our back-end technologies
                and already familiar with Python as applied to web applications.
                Experience with Django or a similar back-end framework is a big
            plus.</li>
            <li><strong>A full-time, front-end developer</strong>. As above, we
                welcome your application even if you have not used all the specific
                technologies in our stack&mdash;so long as you have comparable
                experience and a strong resolve to get up to speed quickly and
                independently.
