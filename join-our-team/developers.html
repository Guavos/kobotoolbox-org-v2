            Core Developer Team Openings<br>
            <small>(for remote contractors)</small>
        </h2>

        <p><a href="http://www.kobotoolbox.org/">KoBoToolbox</a>, developed by
        the <a href="http://hhi.harvard.edu/">Harvard Humanitarian
        Initiative</a> (HHI), is a state-of-the-art, open-source suite of tools
        for data collection and analysis in humanitarian emergencies and other
        challenging environments. HHI's mission is to relieve human suffering
        in war and disaster by advancing the science and practice of
        humanitarian response worldwide.</p>

        <p>We are expanding our core team of developers to meet strong demand
        from the humanitarian community for our tools and expertise. A
        significant new phase of updates and enhancements, conducted in
        coordination with the <a href="http://www.unocha.org/">United Nations
        Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</a> and the <a
        href="http://www.unhcr.org/">UN High Commissioner for Refugees</a>,
        necessitates changes across both front-end and back-end components of
        our software suite.  At this time, <strong>we are looking for a
        full-time, back-end developer</strong> but are also happy to consider
        developers with diverse professional experience, provided they are
        committed to mastering our back-end technologies and are already
        familiar with Python as applied to web applications. Experience with
        Django or a similar back-end framework is a big plus. For reference,
        the KoBo environment includes the following, although experience with
        all of these is <em>not</em> required:</p>

        <table><tr><td>
            <h3>Back-end</h3>

            </ul>
        </td></tr></table>

        <p>Those who join our international team will immediately assume a
        hands-on role with integral responsibilities that include, for
        example:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Writing robust, concise, and reusable code with accompanying
            tests and documentation;</li>
            <li>Searching and reading the code base&mdash;which spans multiple
            libraries, projects, and programming languages&mdash;to understand
            existing behavior and conventions;</li>
            <li>Reviewing other developers' code and providing constructive
            feedback;</li>
            <li>Distilling requests from the humanitarian community into
            technically detailed feature requests (or, sometimes, bug
            reports!);</li>
            <li>Communicating with the public in conjunction with our support
            staff or directly through forums, issue trackers, etc.;</li>
            <li>Shaping the design and architecture of the overall tool suite
            collaboratively with the larger team.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Beyond technical acumen, we value curiosity, initiative,
        persistence, cooperative problem-solving, and egalitarian
        decision-making. Humanitarians around the world will depend on your
        work every day.</p>

        <h3>How to apply</h3>

        year or more) and who can commit significant time to our project
        (at least twenty hours per week, or preferably full-time). If your
        skills and schedule dovetail with our needs, and you are up for the
        challenging-yet-rewarding work of supporting humanitarians worldwide,
