We are incredibly proud to be among the inaugural class of Anthem winners, an inspiring selection of individuals and organizations demonstrating world class talent, insight, leadership, and execution. As our platform looks to empower communities to tell their stories and express their needs, it is an honor to be recognized as a best in class example of work leading the way in the impact industry.

We would like to extend our heartfelt congratulations to all of our co-awardees, including the [World Food Programme (WFP)](https://cdn.wfp.org/2020/technology-innovation-peaceprize/), [American Red Cross](https://www.redcross.org/get-help/disaster-relief-and-recovery-services/meet-clara.html), [charity: water](https://www.charitywater.org/), and [Team Humanity](https://teamhumanity.info/). We are humbled to share this honor with such outstanding organizations.

Anthem Winners are selected by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences. Members include **Daniel Dae Kim** (actor, producer, and activist);  **Ashley Judd** (Author, Actor, and Social Justice Humanitarian); **Mitchell Baker** (CEO and chairwoman, Mozilla); **Lisa Sherman** (president and CEO, Ad Council), **Sarah Kate Ellis** (president and CEO, GLAAD); **Renata Erlikhman** (chief investment officer, OW Management); **Shayla Tait** (director of philanthropy, The Oprah Winfrey Charitable Foundation); **Russlynn Ali** (CEO and co-founder, XQ Institute); **Marc Ecko** (chief commercial officer and board member, XQ Institute); **Heidi Arthur** (chief campaign development officer, Ad Council); and **Alexis M. Herman** (chair and chief executive officer, New Ventures, and former U.S. secretary of labor).

As the world's most widely used humanitarian data collection platform, KoboToolbox receives millions of surveys every month from every corner of the globe. With over 640,000 users, KoboToolbox’s incredible community has already surpassed 300 million survey submissions from over 230 countries and territories, resulting in a global reach of over 170 million people who have been impacted in the past five years. 

KoboToolbox was born out of the urgent need for better data collection tools. Before KoboToolbox, humanitarian organizations mainly collected data by hand, and analysis would often only conclude after critical policy decisions had already been made. Our co-founders, Phuong Pham and Patrick Vinck—today both faculty at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health—knew there needed to be a better way.

“It is our distinct honor to recognize the work that brands, organizations, and individuals are all making to create an impact in their community,” said Jessica Lauretti, Managing Director, The Anthem Awards. “We launched this platform to show the world that all corners of our culture, from sports and entertainment to business leaders and celebrities, are all standing up to say, it is time for systemic change and that social good is what we value as a society.”

Winners for the inaugural Anthem Awards will be celebrated at the first annual Anthem Voices conference followed by a star-studded virtual Awards Show on Monday, February 28, 2022.  Attendees will be able to hear from social impact leaders during the day and then watch the show, featuring special moments, and hallmark speeches from all Anthem Award winners at [www.anthemawards.com](www.anthemawards.com).

The Anthem Awards was launched in response to the prevalence social good has taken within the national conversation and cultural zeitgeist in recent years. The inaugural competition received nearly 2,500 entries from 36 countries worldwide. By amplifying the voices that spark global change, the Anthem Awards are defining a new benchmark for impactful work that inspires others to take action in their communities. A portion of program revenue will fund a new grant program supporting emerging individuals and organizations working to advance the causes recognized in the inaugural Anthem Awards.
