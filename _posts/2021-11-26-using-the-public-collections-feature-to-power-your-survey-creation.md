Creating surveys can be time-consuming and intimidating. You start putting your
form together but drafting questions takes longer than expected. You take care
to make sure you’re wording each question perfectly to ensure you will gather
the right information while doing your best to keep your survey easy to complete
for your target audience.

You also need to spend time building out complicated skip logic throughout the
survey. You wish there was an easier way to have high quality questions,
organized appropriately, that allow you to collect the information you need in a
timely manner.

For years, KoboToolbox users have enjoyed the
[Question Library feature](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/question_library.html)
to **create** and **reuse** survey form content and to the share the same
content with other users.

Now there's a new way of sharing this important content: the
[Public Collections feature](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/using_public_collections.html).

With the Public Collections feature, you can perform many of the same functions
as the Question Library, such as **storing question blocks** (sections of survey
forms) and entire **form templates** for starting new survey projects. Both
features also enable users to store full collections of saved questions blocks
and/or form templates.

What’s new and notable is that with Public Collections, you can **share
templates**, **question blocks**, and **collections** with the **entire Kobo
community**! Anyone can make their collections public by adding relevant
metadata (sectors, countries, description) and it becomes immediately available
to all other users on the same server.

The Public Collections feature helps standardize data collection for thousands
of Kobo users across the world, enabling more straightforward comparisons of
results, which helps to strengthen our data collection and analysis as a
community.

**Getting Started with Public Collections**

You can use Public Collections as a starting point for a new form, rather than
building one from scratch as the Public Collections are fully integrated with
KoboToolbox’s [formbuilder](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/formbuilder.html).
Once you **develop**, **save**, and **share** sets of questions in your public
collection, you can easily import them into new data collection projects on the
KoboToolbox platform.

Using this feature to **save**, **share**, and **reuse** question blocks is
particularly useful as they already contain skip logic conditions, making it
possible to rapidly deploy complex question sequences.

You can also **search**, **filter**, and **sort** through collections shared by
other individuals and organizations to quickly find content relevant to your
survey topic. Simply drag-and-drop the required questions and question blocks
into your new form, and then customize them as needed. Edits made in your own
library will not affect the original library versions.

If you find a collection that’s particularly useful, click **subscribe**, which
allows you to use the blocks from that collection in the formbuilder or start
your survey with a template from the collection.

You’re now ready to power your survey creation using KoboToolbox’s Public
Collections.
